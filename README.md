# JSONified

JSONified specialises in making your legacy or internal data accessible
to the world, with minimum fuss and maximum reliability.

Core technologies used are:

- Apache CouchDB and friends for data layer
- ElasticSearch and CouchDB-Lucene for full-text search and indexing
- Perl, Erlang/OTP, Python or JavaScript and Node.js for integration

We leverage a wide network of cloud vendors and partners to help you get
things done.

With over 20 years of data management expertise, from perl to erlang,
your data couldn't be in better hands.
